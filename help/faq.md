A:
Make sure that:

- You aren't accidentally exiting from the script (don't press any buttons in the command line)
- You're using a command line tool (command prompt or Powershell) or the GUI provided with RLBot
- Your antivirus software isn't interfering with RLBot (add the RLBot directory to your antivirus' exclusion list)
- You're using a recent Python version (Python 3.7 or higher recommended) on Windows
- If all else fails, reboot your computer
